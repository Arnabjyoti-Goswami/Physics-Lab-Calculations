# Physics-Lab-Calculations
This Jupyter notebook is so that there is no need to do the long and manual calculations required for the experiments in which the best fit line needs to be plotted for the observed data points. 

It will generate the following output: best fit line slope and intercept and the errors in these values, and also a sample plot to get an idea of the scale to be chosen for drawing the plot.
